** [2024-11-28 Thu] move .md to .org files
+ also i capitalized files like README or CHANGELOG to indicate their importance.
** [2024-11-28 Thu] python packaging system
+ i tried changing to [[https://python-poetry.org][poetry]] but it caused major headaches (mainly due to my lovely but obscure operating system.)
+ this may have caused some issues with the project, but probably nothing serious (will fix asap if they appear)
+ turns out the better package manager choice is [[https://docs.astral.sh/uv/][uv]]. it's super fast and seem to be what most projects use these days.
** [2024-11-28 Thu] rename src to planetclicker
+ seems to make more sense to call the python module "planetclicker" than "src"
+ it's a little verbose, but we can always change it later.
