# keys.toml
# =========
# description: bind keys to various instructions
# format: instruction = [key_code, ...]
#   - an `instruction` does "something"
#   - a `key_code` defines the keyboard input. it's similar to what pygame uses, but with a couple differences:
# for example, in pygame, `alt-f4` is considered multiple distinct keys (`K_F4`, `K_LALT`, `K_RALT`)
# but here, this is simplified:
#   1. everything is lowercase.
#   2. the `K_` prefix is ignored.
#   3. key combos (eg, `alt-f4`) are specified with a minus sign `-`
#   4. only alt, shift, ctrl are currently supported for combos.
